# autodeleteps if you have create_date in each file name of your files.
Automate delete files with PowerShell if you have bunch of file or pattern with date in name file. In my SQL Backup scenario, my backup file generated with date created in the name file.
So, to delete the file, the pattern we want to delete is the date looping in the script to get the date backdays and delete the file if the file meet the pattern requirement.
